### Datasets

This dataset contains simulated data to mimic customer behaviour to different rewards. The offers are discounts, BOGO (buy one, get one free) and just informational.

There are three datafiles which are used to answer relevant business questions:

1. portfolio.json - contains information about the offers like difficulty, reward or duration
2. profile.json - contains information about each customer
3. transcript.json - contains a record history of each interaction of a custuomer with an offer during the period of that offers.
